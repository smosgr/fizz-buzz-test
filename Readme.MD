NewsUK technical exercise: FizzBuzz
===================================


Problem description
-----------
Write a program that receives as an INPUT an integer and RETURNS Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz, based on the following criteria:
 
* multiples of three print "Fizz"
* multiples of five print "Buzz"
* multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


There's no definite set of rules, but extra points will be given in:

* Running application 
* Good test coverage
* Documentation and instructions 
* Separation of concerns
* Naming
* Use of object oriented principles
* Use of a version control system


How to run it
---------------------------

`./gradlew clean build` will build the application and run the tests. 

What do you want me to do?
--------------------------

When you're done, zip the folder up and send it to the member of the NewsUK recruitment team you are in contact with. 
From here it will be forwarded to our engineers to review. When they receive this, we'll be looking at the following things:

* The ability to build it out of the box using gradle
* The quality and style of code written
* The tests and their structure and coverage
* The documentation provided
* The ability to trace back your commits  

Good luck!
